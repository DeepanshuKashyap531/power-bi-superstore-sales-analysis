# 📊 Power BI Superstore Sales Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end sales and profit analysis** built using **Power BI** on the popular **Superstore dataset**. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to:

* Model data correctly
* Write efficient **DAX measures**
* Build **insight-driven dashboards** (not just visuals)
* Answer real **business questions** using data

This project is designed specifically with **recruiters and interviewers** in mind.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI Desktop**
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
* **Power Query (ETL)**
* **Data Modeling (Star Schema)**
* **Excel / CSV Dataset**

---

## 🗂 Dataset Information

* **Dataset**: Superstore Sales Dataset
* **Time Period**: 2011 – 2014 (4 Years)
* **Main Tables**:

  * Orders (Fact Table)
  * Customers
  * Products
  * Date Table (Custom Calendar)

---

## 🧩 Data Modeling

* Created a **separate Date Table** for time intelligence
* Implemented a **clean and simple data model** based on project needs
* Did **not create multiple dimension tables intentionally** because:

  * The dataset size is relatively small
  * Additional dimension tables were **not necessary** to answer business questions
  * Avoided over-engineering to keep the model **efficient and easy to understand**
* Focused on **clarity, performance, and interview-ready logic** rather than complexity

## 📐 Key DAX Measures Used

Some important measures created in this project:

* Total Sales
* Total Profit
* Total Quantity
* Profit Margin %
* Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales Growth %
* Year-over-Year (YoY) Profit Growth %
* Running Total Sales
* Best Customer (by Quantity & Sales)

> All measures are written using **best DAX practices** with proper use of:

* `CALCULATE()`
* `FILTER()`
* `ALL()` / `REMOVEFILTERS()`
* Time Intelligence functions

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard focuses on **business insights**, not just charts.

### Key Insights Covered:

* Overall Sales & Profit Performance
* YoY Growth Analysis (Sales & Profit)
* Category & Sub-Category Performance
* Top & Bottom Performing Products
* Best Customers by Quantity and Sales
* Regional Performance Comparison
* Monthly and Yearly Trends

---

## 💡 Business Questions Answered

This project answers real-world questions such as:

* Which category and sub-category drive the highest profit?
* Who is the best customer over the last 4 years?
* Which regions are underperforming despite high sales?
* Are sales growing year-over-year, and is profit growing at the same rate?
* Which products have high sales but low or negative profit?

---

## 📈 Why This Project Matters

Many dashboards look good visually but fail to deliver insights.

This project demonstrates:

* Strong understanding of **business logic**
* Ability to translate raw data into **actionable insights**
* Practical use of DAX instead of overloading visuals
* Interview-ready explanations for every KPI

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

1. Download the `.pbix` file from the repository
2. Open it using **Power BI Desktop**
3. Explore the report pages and interact with slicers
4. Review the DAX measures for logic and structure
